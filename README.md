# Windows Manager Tool by Alexander Shemaly

Windows Manager Tool provides tools to users to help organise and change their current display of windows to pre-created setups at the click of a button.
Users can select window instances and the corresponding action they would like to happen, e.g. maximise, restore, focus, etc.
The created setups are then saved and can be called by clicking a button from a list of previously made setups.<br>

_The autoplay feature allows the computer to act like a slideshow._ <br>
When it is enabled, the program will automatically switch the currently displayed window from one setup to another, between fixed time intervals.
The attention of the user is not needed and the order, the duration and windows shown are customisable.

_Available for download on PC_

Program written in Python 3.9 and uses the GUI toolkit. Made in 2021
